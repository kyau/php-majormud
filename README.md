## About

This repository holds the utility classes used for the MajorMUD backend on the VOID BBS website. These are utilized in order to replicate data from BTRIEVE to SQL and to reset daily quests for AfterMUD. These can be used in order to get an idea of how to interact with the BTRIEVE side of things via PHP .
